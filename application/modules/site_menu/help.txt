here in this folder you can see 

(1) menu.sql file .... you have to import in your mysql database
(2) index2.php....using this file you can add and delete menu
(3) hmenu1.php where you can see the menu output
(4) connection.php if you change your database name and table name then you have to change that in connection.php

====>in above part in hmenu1.php you can see css if you want to modify color and arrow then you can modify from there..


Thanks we are web development company in india, So if you have any work regarding the PHP then please contact us.
